## Game Overview

In Bubble Clicker, bubbles flow to the top of the screen. The goal is to click on these bubbles before they float away. Each time you successfully click a bubble, you score points, but if you let them pass, your life decreases. The game ends when you lose all your lives.

## Features

- Scoreboard displaying your current score.
- Life counter indicating how many attempts you have left.
- Bubbles that float to the top and can be clicked to score points.
- Levels that increase the speed of the bubbles as you progress.

## Gameplay Instructions

1. **Score Points**: Click on the bubbles as they float up to score 10 points for each bubble clicked.

3. **Levels and Speed**: As you progress through the game, the speed of the bubbles will increase, making it more challenging. Try to keep up!
4. **Game Over**: The game concludes when you run out of lives. Try to achieve the highest score possible!
